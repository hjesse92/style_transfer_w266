The BART model is a variant of the Transformer model and is pre-trained on a large corpus of text data using a denoising autoencoder objective. It is capable of generating high-quality text with coherent sentence structures.\n","\n","The code defines a PyTorch Dataset class MyDataset that reads the input and target text sequences from a text file and tokenizes them using the BART tokenizer. It then defines the collate_fn function to pad the sequences in each batch to the same length. The code then defines the BartEncoderDecoder class, which is the main model class that uses the BART encoder and decoder architecture.\n","\n","The code instantiates the BART tokenizer and the BartEncoderDecoder model, and loads the training and validation data using the MyDataset class. It also defines the optimizer and loss function. The code then runs the training loop for a specified number of epochs, during which it trains the model on the training set and evaluates it on the validation set.\n","\n","During training, the code iterates over the batches of training data and performs forward and backward passes through the model to compute the loss and update the model parameters using the Adam optimizer. The code also implements gradient accumulation by accumulating the gradients over a specified number of batches to reduce the memory requirements during training. After training on all the batches, the code computes the average loss over the entire training set and evaluates the model on the validation set.\n","\n","During validation, the code iterates over the batches of validation data and generates the predicted text sequences using the generate method of the BART decoder. It then computes the loss between the predicted and target sequences and accumulates the loss over all the batches to compute the average loss over the entire validation set. Finally, the code prints the average training and validation loss for each epoch."]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["#uncomment if memory issue happens.

Limited Batch size to 16 as training dataset has 1584 records. Also used low number of epochs.\n","\n","4. We had a choice to use decoder.generate() or decoder.outputs() to get generated token ids. We will be using generate method. torch.argmax(outputs.logits, dim=-1) gives the index of the highest logit value for each position in the output sequence. This is not the same as the sequence of generated IDs produced by decoder.generate(), because decoder.generate() applies several additional steps during decoding, such as beam search and top-k sampling, that are not present in a simple argmax operation.\n","The decoder.generate() method in BART uses beam search to generate multiple possible sequences, and then returns the highest-scoring sequence according to a scoring function that takes into account both the log-likelihood of the sequence and various penalties for things like repeated n-grams. This process is more complex than simply taking the argmax of the logits, and can lead to better quality generated sequences."],"metadata":{"id":"j-3lmbc0npnT"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"6olz1mhT-ovf","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1680409278327,"user_tz":420,"elapsed":10885,"user":{"displayName":"Shivangi Pandey","userId":"03692652119201342747"}},"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":113,"referenced_widgets":["55576069b02c4bbc92f72e9e1d28a366","e159ccc20e04419fad68e80818ecde1f","aa62785f47f044e99354ac20b111da4f","0488346497e94d78888410a2f76deb8d","2435dfe9eeb74cb88952f4df1ec28db8","3115a677494745a1bae1be89743887d6","a31d8369162343d98ae178bf8b0be1b9","1664894eac484fadbdb618a8299a3fba","671a23797f544a16a67cea2ba84e4a43","a220ba83c16942df8aca9c41be3fec2b","5f5278f335ce4cb18b2edd96aa9c0980","db53c260557f4b5eab5735810134bb7c","1d35805c580c45ecb6162a681a1d7b52","11dc647e8da24ba9b31bad34be106a80","ad3eb561839741d6a5b9c271e06eaf57","b71f08bcc33d4966ba089b7641b97c5d","b6116b765a28480c88c5cf58781a9af8","69d232cb2d624c96a68d3ac11d460320","0ce3d032cd3f47cbb82eec2e242b9725","b87492c2ea3a4963904848eacabc6464","336fc18b50434e3195c8bf3b5ebe1a8b","707aa645f9d94810824f14f8b287f1a7","7bffdec236e9498f8df05b82170bcc48","f2832367ad314310a5636b35277651e6","d9ba8a33c0184fc3b994f640b19311a7","c1cf567114ba4aad9c1e1dc641d8922b","6a9830ff3f3f423abb7d914174f5bc79","9b8842322fca411cb744b84dd13a486f","8d47f52cb3d24f5c98e284822ce3bfc5","f8a32b345d564700aa0cdb3e1161847c","bc1561b4935f47a5a84e3ea623b1421b","02ae6942cecb4c9fb0813490e0f9fdde","00b5b1c0073c439392aa4aa9c1dab72d"]},"outputId":"dffef5bb-b59d-4ac8-eb1b-1be4a6ca8813"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":["Downloading (…)olve/main/vocab.json:   0%|          | 0.00/899k [00:00<?, ?B/s]"],"application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"version_major":2,"version_minor":0,"model_id":"55576069b02c4bbc92f72e9e1d28a366"}},"metadata":{}},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":["Downloading (…)olve/main/merges.txt:   0%|          | 0.00/456k [00:00<?, ?B/s]"],"application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"version_major":2,"version_minor":0,"model_id":"db53c260557f4b5eab5735810134bb7c"}},"metadata":{}},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":["Downloading (…)lve/main/config.json:   0%|          | 0.00/1.72k [00:00<?, ?B/s]"],"application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"version_major":2,"version_minor":0,"model_id":"7bffdec236e9498f8df05b82170bcc48"}},"metadata":{}}],"source":["import torch\n","import torch.nn as nn\n","from torch.utils.data import DataLoader, Dataset\n","from torch.optim import Adam\n","from transformers import BartTokenizer, BartConfig, BartForConditionalGeneration,BartModel,AutoTokenizer\n","from torch.nn.utils.rnn import pad_sequence\n","import torch.nn.functional as F\n","from better_profanity import profanity\n","\n","# Instantiate BART tokenizer\n","tokenizer = BartTokenizer.from_pretrained('facebook/bart-base') \n","profanity.load_censor_words()\n","\n","class MyDataset(Dataset):\n","    \"\"\"\n","    this class generate tokens of input, masked and target sentences \n","    data_path: The path to the training data file.\n","    max_seq_len: The maximum sequence length allowed for the input sequences.\n","    kind : contains value like training, validation etc .
